AI-powered coding sessions
Start an AI-powered coding session tailored to your workflow.
- Copilot Edits allows you to quickly iterate on code changes directly in the editor, across multiple files using natural language.
- For a more autonomous peer programmer experience, agent mode performs multi-step coding tasks at your command. It automatically handles compile and lint errors, monitors terminal and test output, and iterates until the task is complete. 
- Edit mode offers a conversational, step-by-step coding experience. Engage in multi-turn chat conversations while Copilot applies edits directly to your codebase, allowing you to review changes in context and maintain full control.
