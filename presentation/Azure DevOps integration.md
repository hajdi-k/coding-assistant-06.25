AI coding assistants and their Azure DevOps support in June 2025:

- Claude Sonnet 4 – Limited Azure DevOps support via third-party tools. Best for fast coding and logic-heavy tasks.
- GPT-4.1 – No direct Azure DevOps integration, but strong in autonomous coding and agentic code completion.
- Gemini 2.5 Pro – Full Azure DevOps compatibility, offering automated code reviews, repository analysis, and security scanning.
- GitHub Copilot – Partial Azure DevOps support, with manual setup required for PR reviews, commit suggestions, and inline feedback.


Claude Opus 4 is available in GitHub Copilot Chat, but Agent mode currently supports Claude Sonnet 4, not Opus 4. While Opus 4 excels at complex problem-solving and extended reasoning, Sonnet 4 is optimized for coding workflows and is the model used in agentic capabilities.
