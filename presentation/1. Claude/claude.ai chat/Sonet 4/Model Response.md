Perfect! I've created a comprehensive IoT Temperature Logger application that meets all your project requirements. Here's what I've built for you:

## 🎯 **Key Features Implemented**

### **Core Functionality**
- **Smart Temperature Simulation**: Generates realistic indoor temperatures with daily patterns, gradual changes, and proper ranges (18-27°C)
- **OpenWeather API Integration**: Fetches real outdoor temperatures for any global location
- **Temperature Comparison**: Calculates and displays differences with visual indicators
- **Data Logging**: JSON-based storage system with automatic rotation

### **Advanced Features**
- **Multiple Operation Modes**: Demo, single reading, continuous monitoring, and statistics
- **Rich Console Output**: Color-coded temperatures, formatted displays, and trend charts
- **Error Handling**: Robust error management for API failures and file operations
- **Statistics**: Historical analysis with averages, trends, and data visualization

## 🚀 **Getting Started**

1. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. **Get OpenWeather API Key**:
   - Sign up at [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/api)
   - Copy `.env.example` to `.env`
   - Add your API key

3. **Run Demo**:
   ```bash
   npm run demo
   ```

## 📋 **Available Commands**

- `npm run demo` - Quick demonstration with 5 readings
- `npm run single` - Take one temperature reading  
- `npm run monitor` - Continuous monitoring mode
- `npm run stats` - View historical statistics
- `npm run build` - Build for production

## 🏗️ **Architecture Highlights**

- **TypeScript**: Full type safety with comprehensive interfaces
- **Modular Design**: Separate services for simulation, weather, and logging
- **Configuration Management**: Environment-based settings
- **Data Persistence**: JSON logging with statistics and trends
- **Error Resilience**: Graceful handling of network and file system issues

## 📊 **Sample Output**
The application provides rich, formatted output showing:
- Indoor vs outdoor temperatures with visual indicators
- Location information and weather conditions  
- Temperature differences with trend analysis
- Historical statistics and simple ASCII charts

The project is production-ready with proper error handling, logging, and a clean architecture that makes it easy to extend with additional features like database storage or web dashboards.
