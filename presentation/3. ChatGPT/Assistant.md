# OpenAI ChatGPT + Codex
 - Agentic Assitant: Codex https://chatgpt.com/codex
 - Chat: https://chatgpt.com/

## Codex

Codex: a cloud-based software engineering agent that can work on many tasks in parallel. Codex can perform tasks for you such as writing features, answering questions about your codebase, fixing bugs, and proposing pull requests for review; each task runs in its own cloud sandbox environment, preloaded with your repository.

Codex is powered by **codex-1**, a version of OpenAI **o3** optimized for software engineering. It was trained using reinforcement learning on real-world coding tasks in a variety of environments to generate code that closely mirrors human style and PR preferences, adheres precisely to instructions, and can iteratively run tests until it receives a passing result.

As of June 2025 ChatGPT supports agentic code completion without GitHub Copilot. OpenAI has integrated autonomous coding agents into ChatGPT, allowing it to write, debug, and optimize code without external plugins. These agents can:

- Auto-complete code based on project context.
- Refactor and improve existing code.
- Run tests and suggest fixes autonomously.

This makes ChatGPT a standalone coding assistant, competing directly with GitHub Copilot.

## Models 

- GPT-4o-mini (October 2024) – A lighter version of GPT-4o, optimized for quick responses and everyday tasks.
- **GPT-4.1** (December 2024) – Designed for coding and technical tasks, offering improved reasoning and problem-solving capabilities.
- GPT-4.1 mini (December 2024) – A refined version of GPT-4o mini, available for all ChatGPT users.
- GPT-4.5 (February 27, 2025) – A step forward in scaling up pre-training and post-training, designed for chat and creative writing.
- **o3** Model (April 16, 2025) – Excels in math, science, coding, and visual perception, with improved image reasoning.
- o4-mini (April 16, 2025) – A lightweight model designed for fast responses and cost-efficient reasoning, particularly in math, coding, and visual tasks.
- **GPT-4o** (May 16, 2025) – Best for general-purpose tasks, including writing, brainstorming, summarization, and basic coding. It's multimodal, meaning it can process text, images, and audio.
- o3-pro (June 10, 2025) – OpenAI's most advanced reasoning model, optimized for math, science, coding, and business applications.

### Supported in Github Copilot:

- GPT-4.1
- GPT-4o

## Extra:

https://openai.com/index/introducing-canvas/

 GPT Canvas includes coding features, making it easier to write, debug, and refine code interactively. Some key capabilities include:
- Inline code reviews – ChatGPT suggests improvements directly within your code.
- Bug fixing – Detects and rewrites problematic code to resolve errors.
- Code translation – Converts code between JavaScript, Python, C++, Java, and PHP.
- Logging & commenting – Adds print statements and comments for better readability.

Comparison between GPT Canvas and Codex for coding in June 2025:
- GPT Canvas – A visual AI workspace for interactive coding, allowing users to drag, edit, and refine code dynamically. It supports inline debugging, code translation, and structured commenting.
- Codex – A cloud-based AI coding agent, optimized for autonomous code generation, debugging, and testing. It can execute tasks, run tests, and refine code iteratively.
